## 📷 Project Overview

This project is a blind assistive device built with Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensor, DFPlayer Mini, and servo motor. It plays voice messages like “Go back” or “Turn left” based on obstacle distance.

## 📖 How It Works

- Distance ≤ 40 cm → plays “Stop”
- Distance between 15–100 cm → plays “Go Back”
- Distance > 100 cm → plays “Move Forward”
